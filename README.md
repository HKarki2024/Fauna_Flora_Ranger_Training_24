Fauna & Flora is proud to announce the launch of an introductory ranger training module titled Ranger Training: Human Rights in Conservation, designed to equip rangers with essential skills and knowledge to protect human rights while fulfilling their conservation duties. This innovative module, developed and piloted with the Centre Forestier N’Zérékoré and Mukutan rangers, reflects a global commitment to fostering respect, equity, and dignity within protected and conserved areas.
Often based in remote locations and working in areas relied upon by wildlife and people rangers can find themselves in difficult situations where both their own rights and those of local communities are at risk. However, by implementing Standard Operating Procedures, fostering committed management, and offering effective human rights training, we can empower rangers to adopt a stronger, rights-based approach to their work, ensuring it aligns with international standards.

Fauna & Flora and the CITES MIKE Programme, have worked alongside rangers and other law enforcement
professionals for decades through continued conservation efforts. As part of this work training in human
rights have been delivered to various audiences including rangers, NGOs, government officials, and other stakeholders. This work reflects a growing recognition that rangers must go beyond law enforcement to engage meaningfully with communities.

Drawing from this global experience and extensive research, Fauna & Flora has created a hands-on human rights training module, tested in Guinea and Kenya. The program is designed for trainers with basic human rights knowledge and strong facilitation skills. It covers the entire training cycle, from planning to evaluation, blending theory with practical exercises to ensure real-world impact and enhanced integration of human rights into everyday conservation work. Key outputs include recommendations and actions to protect biodiversity while respecting human rights devised by rangers and their management body through participatory training activities.

Key components of the training include:
•	A pre-training key informant survey with rangers.
•	A detailed training manual.
•	Presentation slides.
•	Templates for exercises, handouts, and an optional assessment.
•	Exercises which focus on recommendations and next steps.

This month, rangers from Guinea’s Centre Forestier N’Zerekore will showcase this training at the World Ranger Congress. Join them at the Human Rights World Café Workshop, co-hosted by Fauna & Flora and WCS, on October 9th from 14:30 to 16:00.

The "Ranger Training: Human Rights in Conservation" module is available for download in English and French—don’t miss out!
